To effectively learn Next.js, it helps to be familiar with JavaScript, React,
and related web development concepts. But JavaScript and React are vast
topics. How do you know when you're ready to start using Next.js?

Welcome to the React Foundations course! This beginner-friendly, example-led
course will guide you through the prerequisite knowledge for Next.js. You will
build a simple project step-by-step; starting with a JavaScript application,
then migrating it to React and Next.js.

Each section builds on the previous one, so you can choose where to start
depending on what you already know.

### Prerequisite knowledge

This tutorial assumes knowledge of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and no knowledge of
React. If you're already familiar with React, you can skip to the [From React
to Next.js](/chapter_8) chapter or take [Dashboard App](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app) course.

### System requirements

Before you start this course, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18.17.0 or later installed.
- Operating systems: macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.
- VSCode or another text editor of your choice.
