Let's explore how React helps us add interactivity with **state** and **event
handlers**.

As an example, let's create a "Like" button inside your `HomePage` component.
First, add a button element inside the `return()` statement:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  const names = ["Ada Lovelace", "Grace Hopper", "Margaret Hamilton"];

  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li key={name}>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <button>Like</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Listening to events

To make the button do something when clicked, you can use the `onClick` event:

```jsx
index.html

    function HomePage() {
      // ...
      return (
        <div>
          {/* ... */}
          <button onClick={}>Like</button>
        </div>
      );
    }
```

In React, event names are camelCased. The `onClick` event is one of many
possible events you can use to respond to user interaction. For example, you
can use `onChange` for input fields or `onSubmit` for forms.

## Handling events

You can define a function to "handle" events whenever they are triggered.
Create a function before the return statement called `handleClick()`:

```jsx
index.html

    function HomePage() {
      // ...

      function handleClick() {
        console.log("increment like count")
      }

      return (
        <div>
          {/* ... */}
    	  <button onClick={}>Like</button>
        </div>
         )
       }
```

Then, you can call the `handleClick` function when the `onClick` event is
triggered:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // 	...
  function handleClick() {
    console.log("increment like count");
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Like</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Try running this in your browser. Notice in your developer tools how the log
output increases.

## State and hooks

React has a set of functions called [hooks](https://react.dev/learn). Hooks
allow you to add additional logic such as **state** to your components. You
can think of state as any information in your UI that changes over time,
usually triggered by user interaction.

![Two different examples of state: 1. A toggle button that can be selected or
unselected. 2. A like button that can be clicked multiple
times.](https://vvlp2wl4yesgvvvr.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/vercel/react/learn-state-4ucGtGZIhsLmgm6l4uRYdIhX8NEEsH.webp)

You can use _state_ to store and increment the number of times a user has
clicked the "Like" button. In fact, the React hook used to manage state is
called: `useState()`

Add `useState()` to your project. It returns an array, and you can access and
use those array values inside your component using **array destructuring** :

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [] = React.useState();

  // ...
}
```

The first item in the array is the state `value`, which you can name anything.
It's recommended to name it something descriptive:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes] = React.useState();

  // ...
}
```

The second item in the array is a function to `update` the value. You can name
the update function anything, but it's common to prefix it with `set` followed
by the name of the state variable you're updating:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState();

  // ...
}
```

You can also take the opportunity to add the initial value of your `likes`
state to `0`:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0);
}
```

Then, you can check the initial state is working by using the state variable
inside your component.

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0);
  // ...

  return (
    // ...
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Like({likes})</button>
  );
}
```

Finally, you can call your state updater function, `setLikes` in your
`HomePage` component, let's add it inside the `handleClick()` function you
previously defined:

```jsx
index.html;

function HomePage() {
  // ...
  const [likes, setLikes] = React.useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* ... */}
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Likes ({likes})</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Clicking the button will now call the `handleClick` function, which calls the
`setLikes` state updater function with a single argument of the current number
of likes + 1.

## Managing state

This was only an introduction to state, and there's more you can learn about
managing state and data flow in your React applications. To learn more, we
recommend you go through the [Adding
Interactivity](https://react.dev/learn/adding-interactivity) and [Managing
State](https://react.dev/learn/managing-state) sections in the React
documentation.
