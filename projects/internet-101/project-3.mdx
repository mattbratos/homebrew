# Project: DNS Lookup and Explanation

## 1. Project Overview
In this project, you will use the `nslookup` command-line tool to find the IP addresses of a domain, such as `example.com`. You will then describe how DNS resolution works using your findings as a reference. This project will solidify your understanding of the Domain Name System (DNS) and provide practical experience with a common network diagnostic tool.

## 2. Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand the purpose and function of DNS.
- Learn how to use the `nslookup` tool for DNS queries.
- Describe the process of DNS resolution.
- Gain insights into different types of DNS records.

## 3. Required Tools/Setup
- A computer with a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal.
- Internet access to perform DNS queries.
- Basic knowledge of using CLI commands.

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Command Line Interface
Open your terminal or command-line interface on your computer. This can be Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux.

### Step 2: Run the nslookup Command
Type the following command and press Enter to find the IP addresses for `example.com`:
```bash
nslookup example.com
```

### Step 3: Examine the Output
The `nslookup` command will return information about the DNS query. It should look something like this:
```
Server:  dns.example.net
Address:  192.0.2.1

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:    example.com
Addresses:  93.184.216.34
```

### Step 4: Understand DNS Resolution
Based on the `nslookup` output:
- The first section (Server and Address) shows the DNS server being used for the query.
- The second section (Non-authoritative answer) provides the resolved IP addresses of the domain `example.com`.

The process of DNS resolution can be broken down into these steps:
1. A user types `example.com` in their browser.
2. The browser checks its cache to see if it already knows the IP address for `example.com`.
3. If not found, the request is sent to the local DNS resolver provided by your ISP.
4. The local DNS resolver checks its cache and, if the IP is not there, contacts a root DNS server.
5. The root server directs the resolver to a Top-Level Domain (TLD) DNS server for `.com`.
6. The resolver contacts the TLD server, which directs it to the authoritative DNS server for `example.com`.
7. The authoritative DNS server returns the IP address for `example.com`.
8. The resolver sends the IP address back to the browser, which then accesses the website.

### Step 5: Query for Different DNS Records
To get more information, you can specify the type of DNS record you want to query. For example, to get MX (Mail Exchange) records, use:
```bash
nslookup -query=MX example.com
```

### Step 6: Analyze Different Types of DNS Records
Common DNS record types include:
- **A**: Address record, translates a domain to an IP address.
- **AAAA**: IPv6 address record.
- **MX**: Mail exchange record, specifies mail servers for a domain.
- **CNAME**: Canonical name record, alias of one name to another.
- **TXT**: Text records, used for various text-based data.

## 5. Code Snippets

### Basic nslookup Command
```bash
nslookup example.com
```

### Querying MX Records
```bash
nslookup -query=MX example.com
```

### Querying Specific DNS Server
```bash
nslookup example.com 8.8.8.8
```

## 6. Testing and Validation
Verify that the `nslookup` commands return the expected results:
1. Ensure that the domain name resolves to the correct IP addresses.
2. Confirm that different types of DNS queries (A, MX, CNAME) return appropriate results.
3. Cross-check the returned addresses with a web browser or other lookup tools to ensure accuracy.

## 7. Bonus Challenges (Optional)
- **Explore Reverse DNS Lookup**: Use `nslookup` to perform a reverse DNS lookup to find the domain name associated with an IP address.
```bash
nslookup 93.184.216.34
```
- **Automate nslookup with a Script**: Write a simple script to automate `nslookup` queries for multiple domains.
- **Investigate DNS Propagation**: Change DNS settings for a domain you control and observe how quickly changes propagate by performing `nslookup` at different intervals.

This project will not only enhance your understanding of DNS but also provide you with practical skills in network diagnostics. Happy learning!
