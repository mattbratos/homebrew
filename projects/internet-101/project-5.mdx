# Analyze Network Traffic Project

## Project Overview
In this project, you will use a basic network analysis tool, like Wireshark, to capture and analyze network traffic on your computer. Your task is to identify and categorize different types of network traffic over a short duration. This will give you hands-on experience with real network data, helping you understand internet protocols, traffic types, and potential security issues.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will learn to:

- Capture network traffic using Wireshark.
- Analyze and categorize different types of network traffic.
- Identify common protocols in network traffic.
- Recognize potential security threats in network data.

## Required Tools/Setup
- Wireshark: Free and open-source packet analyzer. Download it from [Wireshark's official website](https://www.wireshark.org/).
- A computer with an internet connection.
- Basic understanding of network protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.).

## Step-by-step Instructions

### Step 1: Install Wireshark
1. Download and install Wireshark from the [official website](https://www.wireshark.org/).
2. Follow the installation instructions appropriate for your operating system.

### Step 2: Capture Network Traffic
1. Launch Wireshark.
2. Select your network interface (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) from the list.
3. Click on the "Start Capturing Packets" button (the blue shark fin icon).

### Step 3: Analyze Network Traffic
1. Let Wireshark capture data for around 5-10 minutes while you perform typical internet activities (e.g., browsing, watching a video).
2. Click on the "Stop Capturing Packets" button (the red square icon) to stop the capture.

### Step 4: Filter Traffic
1. In the Wireshark filter bar, enter `http` to filter for HTTP traffic.
2. Similarly, you can filter for other protocols:
   - `dns` for DNS traffic.
   - `https` for HTTPS traffic.
   - `tcp` or `udp` for TCP or UDP traffic.

### Step 5: Identify and Categorize Traffic
1. Look through the filtered packets and take note of:
   - Source and destination IP addresses.
   - Protocol used.
   - Flags or status codes in the packet details.
2. Categorize the packets based on their protocol:
   - Web browsing: HTTP, HTTPS.
   - DNS queries: DNS.
   - Other types such as FTP, SMTP, if any.

## Code Snippets

### Filtering HTTP Traffic
Use the filter field in Wireshark to enter:
```
http
```

### Filtering DNS Traffic
Use:
```
dns
```

### Filtering HTTPS Traffic
Use:
```
https
```

## Testing and Validation
To ensure your captures and analysis are correct:
1. Verify that the traffic you generated matches your normal internet activity.
2. Check that the packet details (e.g., source/destination, data) are consistent with what is expected for each protocol.
3. Cross-reference the traffic types with known internet usage patterns to ensure proper categorization.

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)
- Identify any unusual or unexpected traffic and research its origin and purpose.
- Capture traffic from different types of devices (e.g., smartphone, IoT device) and compare traffic patterns.
- Use Wireshark's built-in tools to generate visualizations (e.g., protocol hierarchy, flow graphs).

By following and completing this project, you will gain a practical understanding of network traffic analysis and the ability to recognize common and potentially harmful network activities.
