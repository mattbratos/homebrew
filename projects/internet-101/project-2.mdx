# Use Network Diagnostic Tools

## 1. Project Overview

In this project, you will use network diagnostic tools to perform basic diagnostics on a popular website, `google.com`. You will utilize `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup` to gather information about the website's network connectivity, routing paths, and DNS resolution. You will then record and explain your findings.

## 2. Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will be able to:

- Use `ping` to test network connectivity and measure round-trip time (RTT)
- Use `traceroute` to display the route packets take to the destination
- Use `nslookup` to query DNS records and understand domain name resolution
- Interpret the output of these tools and explain their significance

## 3. Required Tools/Setup

To complete this project, you will need:

- A computer with internet access
- Terminal access (Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux)

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Using `ping`

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type the following command to ping `google.com`:
   ```sh
   ping google.com
   ```
3. Observe the output. This command sends ICMP echo requests to `google.com` and displays the round-trip time (RTT) for each packet.

### Step 2: Interpreting `ping` Results

- Check if packets are being sent and received successfully.
- Note the time it takes for packets to travel to `google.com` and back (RTT).
- If packets are lost or the time is unusually high, it may indicate network issues.

### Step 3: Using `traceroute`

1. In your terminal, type the following command to use `traceroute`:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     traceroute google.com
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```sh
     tracert google.com
     ```
2. Observe the output. This command displays the path that packets take from your computer to `google.com`, showing each hop along the way.

### Step 4: Interpreting `traceroute` Results

- Each line represents a hop between network devices.
- Delays at specific hops can indicate congestion or issues at that point.
- If `*` symbols appear, it may indicate that a hop didn't respond within the timeout.

### Step 5: Using `nslookup`

1. In your terminal, type the following command to use `nslookup` for `google.com`:
   ```sh
   nslookup google.com
   ```
2. Observe the output. This command queries DNS servers to resolve the domain name `google.com` into an IP address.

### Step 6: Interpreting `nslookup` Results

- The output shows the DNS server used to perform the query.
- It provides the IP address(es) associated with `google.com`.
- Verify if the DNS resolution matches the expected IP addresses for `google.com`.

## 5. Code Snippets

```sh
# Ping google.com
ping google.com

# Traceroute to google.com (macOS/Linux)
traceroute google.com

# Traceroute to google.com (Windows)
tracert google.com

# DNS lookup for google.com
nslookup google.com
```

## 6. Testing and Validation

- Confirm that you can successfully run `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup` commands.
- Validate that `ping` results show successful packet delivery and reasonable RTT.
- Ensure `traceroute` results show a complete path to `google.com` without unexplained delays or timeouts.
- Verify `nslookup` correctly resolves `google.com` to known IP addresses.

## 7. Bonus Challenges (Optional)

- Try using network diagnostic tools on different websites such as `github.com` or `yourfavoritewebsite.com`.
- Investigate and explain any differences in output between different websites.
- Use `whois` to gather more information about the domain registration details and ownership.

This project will help you become proficient in using essential network diagnostic tools and interpreting their results to assess network connectivity and performance.
